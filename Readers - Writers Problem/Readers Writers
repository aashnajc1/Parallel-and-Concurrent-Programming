Readers - Writer problem - 
Consider a situation where we have a file shared between many people.
->If one of the people tries editing the file, no other person should be reading or writing at the same time, otherwise changes will not be visible to him/her.
->However if some person is reading the file, then others may read it at the same time. Precisely in OS we call this situation as the readers-writers problem

Problem parameters:
o One set of data is shared among a number of processes
o Once a writer is ready, it performs its write. Only one writer may write at a time
o If a process is writing, no other process can read it
o If at least one reader is reading, no other process can write
o Readers may not write and only read
